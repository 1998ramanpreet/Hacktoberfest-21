*Our security policy is to avoid leaving the ecosystem worse than we found it. Meaning we are not planning to introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem.*

Our team and community take all security bugs in Hacktoberfest-21 seriously. Thank you for improving the security of Hacktoberfest-21. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at [@hkaur008](https://github.com/hkaur008/) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line..
